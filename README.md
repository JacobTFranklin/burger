# Eat-Da-Burger
Eat-Da-Burger is a node-based express application that uses a MySql database to store and manipulate burger data. Using an MVC framework, the application's ORM queries a locally hosted database when ran locally, and a cloud-based database through JawsDB when ran otherwise.

On the client side, Express-Handlebars renders the data. jQuery handles the event listeners in which the user interacts with.
